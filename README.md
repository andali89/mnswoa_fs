# MNSWOA

## Introduction
This is an implementation of a multi-objective optimization algorithm called 
modified nondominated-sorting-based whale optimization algorithm (MNSWOA)
for key quality characteristic identification (feature selection) in production processes .
The optimization algorithm adapts the single objective whale optimization algorithm (WOA) into 
the multi-objective scenario with several new components, i.e., a modified non-dominated sorting
approach, a uniform reference solution selection strategy, and mutation operations. 
For a detailed description of the method please refer to

characteristic identification in production processes using a nondominated-sorting-based 
whale optimization algorithm. Computers & Industrial Engineering, 149, 106852.

## Usage
- To start with this package, just open the [Main.m](./matlabcode/Main.m) file with Matlab and you will find out how to use it. 
- This package is built based on the [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/), so JAVA is required in your system.

## Notes
The source code is established based on the original code of whale optimization algorithm (WOA) proposed by Prof. [Seyedali Mirjalili](http://www.alimirjalili.com).
